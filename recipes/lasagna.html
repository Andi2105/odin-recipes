    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      The lasagna of Naples, lasagne di carnevale, is layered with local
      sausage, small fried meatballs, hard-boiled eggs, ricotta and mozzarella
      cheeses, and sauced with a Neapolitan ragù, a meat sauce. Lasagne al
      forno, layered with a thicker ragù and béchamel sauce and corresponding to
      the most common version of the dish outside Italy, is traditionally
      associated with the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. Here, and especially
      in its capital, Bologna, layers of lasagna are traditionally green (the
      color is obtained by mixing spinach or other vegetables into the dough)
      and served with ragù (a thick sauce made from onions, carrots, celery,
      finely ground pork and beef, butter, and tomatoes), bechamel and
      Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other regions lasagna can be made with various combinations of ricotta
      or mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, meats (such as ground beef, pork or
      chicken), and vegetables (such as spinach, zucchini, olives, mushrooms),
      and the dish is typically flavoured with wine, garlic, onion, and oregano.
      In all cases, the lasagne are baked (al forno). Traditionally pasta dough
      prepared in Southern Italy used semolina and water; in the northern
      regions, where semolina was not available, flour and eggs were used. In
      modern Italy, since the only type of wheat allowed for commercially sold
      pasta is durum wheat, industrial lasagna are made of semolina from durum
      wheat. Nonetheless, in the north and especially in Emilia-Romagna, the
      tradition of egg-based dough remains popular for artisanal and home-made
      productions

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)</li>
        <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
    <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
    <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
    <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
    </ol>
