      A milkshake (sometimes simply called a shake) is a sweet beverage made by
      blending milk, ice cream, and flavorings or sweeteners such as
      butterscotch, caramel sauce, chocolate syrup, fruit syrup, or whole fruit
      into a thick, sweet, cold mixture. It may also be made using a base made
      from non-dairy products, including plant milks such as almond milk,
      coconut milk, or soy milk
